# OneTimeUse

data object [OneTimeUse](index.md) : [CreateDocumentSettings.CredentialPolicy](../index.md)

Policy that deletes the credential after a single use.

This policy ensures credentials cannot be reused, providing enhanced security by minimizing the timeframe during which credentials are available in the system. It's particularly suitable for high-security scenarios.
