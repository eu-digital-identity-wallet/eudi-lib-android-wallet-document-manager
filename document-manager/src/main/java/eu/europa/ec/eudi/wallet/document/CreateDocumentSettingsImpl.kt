/**
 * Implementation of [CreateDocumentSettings] interface that provides configuration for document creation.
 *
 * This class encapsulates all necessary parameters required when creating digital documents
 * through the [DocumentManager.createDocument] method. It specifies where document keys should be
 * stored, how they should be created, and defines credential management policies.
 *
 * @property secureAreaIdentifier The secure area identifier where the document's keys should be stored.
 *                               This identifier must reference an existing secure area in the system.
 * @property createKeySettings The configuration settings for key creation within the specified secure area.
 *                            These settings control properties such as key algorithms, sizes, and other
 *                            security parameters required by the secure area implementation.
 * @property numberOfCredentials The number of credentials to create for this document. Multiple credentials
 *                              can be used for load balancing or redundancy. Defaults to 1 if not specified.
 *                              Must be greater than 0.
 * @property credentialPolicy Defines how credentials are managed after use. Controls whether credentials are
 *                           used once and deleted or rotated through multiple uses.
 *                           Defaults to [CredentialPolicy.RotateUse].
 *
 * @see CreateDocumentSettings The interface this class implements
 * @see DocumentManager For usage in document creation operations
 * @see CredentialPolicy For available credential management policies
